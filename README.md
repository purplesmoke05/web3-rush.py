## 📚 Usage

The usage of web3-rush.py is very similar to web3.py. Here's a simple example:

```python
from web3_rush import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
web3 = Web3('https://your-ethereum-node-url')

# Get an account
account = web3.eth.accounts[0]

# Send Ether
transaction = {
    "from": account,
    "to": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e",
    "value": web3.toWei(1, "ether"),
    "gas": 21000,
    "gasPrice": web3.toWei("50", "gwei"),
    "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account),
}

# Sign and send transaction
transaction_hash = web3.eth.send_transaction(transaction)

# Get transaction receipt
transaction_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(transaction_hash)

print(transaction_receipt)
```
